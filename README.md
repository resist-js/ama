- :bug: Bugs & Feature Requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker (i.e., on the issue tracker of the corresponding [GitHub](https://github.com/resist-js/) repository).
- :signal_strength: Support questions are better asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and maths questions on [Math Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/).
